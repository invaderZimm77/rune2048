### MVP/PostMVP
 
The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion. 
 
#### MVP
 
- Gets all the post from the API and maps the usernames as links on the home page
- The usernameLinks take you to the individual post
- Add new entries to the api
 
#### PostMVP 
- Add delete button
- Add tic-tac-toe game
- Add grouping for multiple entries for the same username
- Add 2048
