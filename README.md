The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Gets all the post from the API and maps the usernames as links on the home page 
- the usenameLinks take you to the individual post

#### PostMVP  
- add delete button
- add tic-tac-toe game
-
